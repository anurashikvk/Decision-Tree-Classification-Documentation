# Decision-Tree-Classification-Documentation
Welcome to the Decision Tree Classification documentation! This guide provides information on what Decision Tree Classification is, how to use it, and includes examples to help you get started.

## 1. What is Decision Tree Classification?

Decision Tree Classification is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step. The result is a tree-like structure where each leaf node represents a class label.

## 2. How to Use Decision Tree Classification

### 2.1 Installation

To use Decision Tree Classification, you'll need to have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn

```

### 2.2 Usage

Here's a basic example of using Decision Tree Classification in Python:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load your dataset and split it into training and testing sets
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a Decision Tree Classifier
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

```


## 3. Best Practices

- Feature Scaling: Decision Trees are not sensitive to feature scaling, so you don't need to normalize or standardize your data.
- Avoid Overfitting: Prune the tree or use techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
